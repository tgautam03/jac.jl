# JAC

> I would recommend going through the short theoretical introduction to Automatic Differentiation explained [here](https://github.com/tgautam03/jac.jl/blob/master/README.md) before moving forward with the implementation details.

The documentation is divided into two broad sections:

- **Development**: Here you'll find a more story like blogs showing the development of **JAC** over time (one step at a time).
- **Manual**: Description of each struct, function, etc so that you don't have to dig through the code base to find how it's implemented.
